# GenshinYOLO23
YOLOv5s model finetuned on a dataset of Genshin Impact monster screenshots. This dataset contains annotations of 23 classes and a script to easily refactor the file structure for training with YOLOv5.

Here's my [model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16NkunYLmxiSxuTbmzZ6GLgjemjcQz0fU/view?usp=sharing) and [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RKqcAJU3Njud5zFuHd2_xngcwssSJSke/view?usp=sharing).
